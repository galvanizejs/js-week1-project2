** Week 1 - Project 2 **

Below are a number of problems for you to solve
using JS. The JS code can be written below each
problem and the result can be logged to the console.
In order to make the results easy to read,
please use console.log("Question #") to declare the
problem number being solved followed by console.log(yourAnswer) after each question.

EXAMPLE:
// 1. Log your 'hello world' to the console.
console.log("Question 1")
console.log("hello world")

=======================================================
*/



// 1. Log your name to the console (as a string).
console.log("Question 1");




// 2. Declare a new variable called 'name',
//    store your name within it
//    and then log it to the console.





// 3. Declare two variables with number values.
//    Add, subtract, multiply and divide them.
//    Display the values of each within the console.





// 4. Declare two variables with string values.
//    Create a third variable that concatenates the two strings
//    that also places a space between the strings.
//    Log the value of the third variable to the console.




// 5. Add, subract, multiply and divide the strings '5' and '3'.
//    Observe the results and brieftly explain the results within the console.





// 6. Create an simple alert stating anything you wish. 





// 7. Create a prompt that asks a user to pick a number.
//    Then double user's answer and log that into the console.






// 8. Set the variable 'num1' to 5.
//    Set the variable 'num2' to 10.
//    Test to see if num1 is greater than num2. 
//    If so, output to the console: Yes, the value of num1 is greater than num2
//    If not, output to the console: No, the value of num1 is not greater than num2






// 9. Set the variable 'score' to a number between 1-100. 
//    Create the following conditions:
//    If the score is above 90, output to the console "great job".
//    If the score is between 60 and 89, output to the console "nice work, keep practicing".
//    If the score is below 59, output to the console "very bad: study more and retake the test".



// ADVANCED TRACK

// A. Ask for a user's name, age and city using a prompt.
//    In a single command, take the user's answers and log the sentence:
//   "My name is __. I'm __ years old, and I live in __."





// B. Create an alert that displays the response from a prompt. You can prompt the user for any kind of fun response. 





// C. Create the formula to determine the area of a rectangle.
//     The rectangle is: 2 inches by 3 inches
//     Display the result in the console. 



// D. Prompt users to input the length and width of a rectangle and log the result.





// E. Prompt a user for their name. Find the length (number of characters) of their name and display the result in the console. 




// F. Set a prompt to request a test between a score of 0-100 from the user. 
//    If the score is above 90, set an alert to tell the user "great job".
//    If the score is between 60 and 89, set an alert to tell the user "nice work, keep practicing".
//    If the score is below 59, set an alert to tell the user "very bad: study more and retake the test".




// SANDBOX TRACK

// Solving all of these problems is a great step in the right direction, but the next step is coming up 
// with your own arrangements to solve new problems. Create your own stories to solve and find the solution. 
// Feel free to share with your classmates to challenge them! 







// Congrats! You are complete!
